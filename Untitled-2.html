                    <h2>Introduction to Cervical Spondylosis</h2>
                    <p style="line-height:34px;">Cervical spondylosis is a common term to describe the spinal disc’s
                        wear and tear issues present in our neck. The problem is common among aged people. The
                        reason for this is that with consistent shrink and dehydration of the disks, osteoarthritis
                        signs develop to cause bony projects across the bones’ edges i.e. bone spurs.</p>

                    <h3>1. Bone Spurs or Bone Overgrowth</h3>
                    <p>Bone spurs or bone overgrowth takes place when the human body tries to grow extra bone to
                        enhance the spinal strength. However, the extra bone may press the spine’s delicate areas,
                        like the nerves, and spinal cord, which results in mild to severe pain.</p>

                        material. The material presses on the nerves and spinal cord to cause pain across the arm,
                        arm numbness, and other similar types of symptoms. </p>

                    <h3>3. Dehydrated Spinal Discs </h3>
                    <p>Your spinal bones have spinal discs, which are pad-like and thick cushions, which absorb the
                        shock of twisting, lifting, and other activities. These gel-type materials present in discs
                        may dry out with time, which force rubbing together of your bones or spinal vertebrae to
                        make your spine and neck pain</p>
